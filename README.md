# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard website that allows the user to search a city and get the weather data for that city. Provides data for the present day, and weather for the next 5 days. Data includes temp, wind speed, and humidity, as well as an icon showing the general look of the weather that day. This website was created as a challenge for a coding bootcamp class, meant to be a wrap-up for all things frontend. It helped me figure out how to fetch data from an api better, and how to use parameters as well.
